# JavaScript Mini Projects Repository
Welcome to the JavaScript Mini Projects repository! This repository is a collection of various small-scale JavaScript projects that I've created to improve my coding skills and explore different aspects of web development. Each project is designed to focus on specific concepts, techniques, or features of JavaScript.
